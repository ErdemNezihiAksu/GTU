### Explonation

    All 3 files types are a class inherited from file abstract class (FILE.HPP).

    file class has an template iterator class implemented. For directories, it allows you to traverse the files and directories inside. For files, it allows you to read the context by traversing char by char.

    Linked files are only a pointer to the real file, every command works the same on them as the real files.
